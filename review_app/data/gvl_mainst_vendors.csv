Each summer they head to Alaska to participate in the largest Sockeye salmon fishery in the world. After their salmon are caught, they are placed into an icy bath that quickly cools them & then delivered to a processing facility to preserve the ""just-caught"" freshness. The salmon is then transported by barge to Seattle & trucked across the country to the Carolinas. Thewildsalmonco.com",https://www.facebook.com/pages/Heidis-Wild-Salmon/270656416343588?fref=ts
